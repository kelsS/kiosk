						A quaint row of shops in its heyday, this area was home to many popular digs of the 21st century, from bygone Indian cuisine to local beegeuse shops (once called honey by our ancestors). Construction for the shopping outlet was put on hold once a state of emergency was declared by local governments, issued after the threat of nuclear attacks. Martial law was enacted but authorities were unable to evacuate the city in time.

						Many of the areas our tour will be exploring on this road were not entirely destroyed. We will be able to view several 21st century cars (obsolete transportation devices of this time) as well as architecture of many buildings, one of which is a replica of the flat iron building, the original was built in one of the largest cities on Earth, called New York City. Another attraction has been constructed to showcase some of the few mutated creatures that have survived. This interactive petting zoo is located two blocks down Battery Park Avenue.

						*Bioshell suits and gloves must be worn at all times while interacting with the wild life.
